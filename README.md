# Training-Policy-Models-with-Supervised-Summarization-Reward-Learning-and-PPO-RLHF

## README.md

This repository contains code for training three different policy models:

1. **Supervised Summarization Policy:** This model learns to summarize factual prompts based on a provided dataset.
2. **Reward Model:** This model learns to assign rewards to different responses based on their sentiment and relevance to the prompt.
3. **PPO Policy:** This model utilizes the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm to train a policy for generating responses based on the prompt and the learned reward function.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* transformers library
* datasets library
* trl library
